# Motion Detection Alert System

This is a simple IoT-based project that detects motion using a PIR sensor and ESP8266 microcontroller. When motion is detected, it sends an alert through a Python Flask server.

## Features
- Detects motion in real-time
- Sends email alerts when motion is detected
- Easy to set up and use

## Components Used
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Python (Flask)
- Internet Connection

## How It Works
1. PIR sensor detects movement.
2. ESP8266 sends data to the Flask server.
3. The server sends an email to the user as an alert.

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the PIR sensor to the ESP8266.
2. Flash the code to ESP8266.
3. Run the Flask server on your computer.
4. Make sure both ESP8266 and server are connected to the same network.
